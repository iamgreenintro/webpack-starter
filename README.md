# Easy Webpack Starter/Baseline Setup (Vanilla JS):

### Why? There are plenty of other webpack starters out there!

Yes, while it's true there are others out there, such as https://github.com/wbkd/webpack-starter (which is used a lot!), and even Webpack's documentation mentions https://createapp.dev/webpack as a tool to create one (the website's UI is crap as of 09/01/2024). It doesn't mean we should use them because we can't seem to find that old project with a nice configuration, or simply because we are lazy. The decision was made: "Never configure webpack from scratch again, only maintain!".

## Who is this for?

- Anyone looking to code a Vanilla JavaScript project.
- Anyone looking to start a quick project and package it for distribution.
- Anyone looking for a live-reload dev server (while caching the node_modules and other vendors!).
- Anyone looking to learn about webpack (it comes with a ridiculous amount of comments).

<b>This project is very basic and serves no other purpose than to quickly set up a project and to skip the configuration progress. Please do contribute to the project as it's far from perfect.</b>

## Todo (in no specific order):

- Add usage guide.
- Add multiple entry points example configuration with libraries included like bootstrap and jQuery.
- Add branch `feature/ts` that has supports TS
- Add a way for using it via npm by having it pull in all dependencies required by the configurations.
- Forget about, or to maintain this project and end up reconfiguring Webpack all over again..
