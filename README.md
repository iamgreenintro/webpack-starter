# A Webpack 5 Starter Project (Vanilla JS)

### Why?

There's many webpack starter projects out there. Many are out of date or lack configuration. To save time it would be nice to have a ready-to-go and up to date starter project.

### Description:

An easy customizable webpack starter project that works out of the box. Each webpack configuration setting comes with elaborate comments allowing you to understand and customize the config files yourself!

## Features

- **Stylesheets have their own entry point.** No need to import it into your app's main entry point via the source code.
- **Development server** configured for optimal speed.
- Webpack configuration for `production` and `development` out of the box.
- Extensive comments in the configuration files for understanding and configuring the project yourself.

### Documentation:

- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/)
- My comments in the configuration files.
